	<h3>Who We Are</h3>

	<p>At DFM Web Studio, we will kick start your endeavor, however big or small, with a website that meets your functional and stylistic needs. We offer ongoing support for our sites which includes getting your domain name, hosting your site, fixing problems that arise, and making small ongoing changes to adapt to your changing needs. We're a small company, so unlike other big firms, you'll get personal attention to ensure that you're happy with what we deliver.</p>

	<h3>Who We Aren't</h3>

	<p>Being a small firm allows us to offer you a lot in terms of personalization. However, it also means that there are some clients whose needs we won't be able to meet. If you need a large-scale web application, then we're probably not the guys for you. But don't let that stop you from reaching out to us. We have friends in high places, so we'll do our best to direct you to someone who is suited for your needs. At no cost, of course.</p>

	<h3>Where We're From</h3>

	<p>We're based in Pasadena, CA, USA. So if you're in the area, we're more than happy to schedule a face-to-face consultation. If you're somewhere else, then we can do all our consultations over email and <a href="//www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a>. To set something up, head over to our <a href="/contact/">Contact Form</a>.
